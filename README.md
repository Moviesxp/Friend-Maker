# Friend-Maker
A project that I really want to exist - a game where you make crazy characters called 'friends' and have fun with them.

Create friends in a simple and easy-to-use editor!
Play with them and solve their problems - It will give you coins to spend on more fun items!

I cannot program a character creation system - I've tried, with 3 versions of Charamaker (Legacy, Unreleased remake, Unreleased restart) and didn't end well.
